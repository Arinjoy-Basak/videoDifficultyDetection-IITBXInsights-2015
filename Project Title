TOPIC OF PROJECT:
-----------------
1. 'Blended MOOCs specifications and user documentation' 2. Data Analytics - Detection of difficulty areas 
in videos based on student viewing activity











































 and its notification to the instructors with aim to improving 
content lucidity, and assessing video utilization by students.

The aim of this project is to be able to detect regions in videos that are seemingly problematic to the students, and alert
the course instructor about such cases, so that he may appropriately address the issue. To be specific, the system we plan to
design would assess all the videos under a particular course based on the number of accesses to it, the amount of time spent
on it, and most importantly - the regions in the video that are repeatedly accessed and reviewed by the students, an activity
that we attribute to being unable to understand a certain lesson or fact or axiom that is presented in that segment of the
lecture video. Such occurrences and statistics are to be accumulated, mapped and filtered, and ultimately presented to the 
instructors who would want their students to extract quality information from their courses. It is hence of their utmost 
concern as to whether a certain part of the video is comparatively unintelligible to the masses involved in his course, 
compared to the other videos - so that he may include further "bonus" lessons, extra exercises, or forum discussions on the
same topic, as necessary, to clarify the issues one may have regarding the matter which is under question. In the worst case,
the instructor might even have to replce the video with an improved version of the video, in which case, this new video would
be brought under the same type of processing as the other ones.
