 File synchronization is all about keeping two different locations on 
same or different storing devices synchronized with each other. There 
are two types of file synchronizations:
</p><p>1. Keeping one location sync'ed with another so that if some 
changes are made on one location, they are reflected on the other end, 
but NOT vice versa. This basically means that if files are added or 
changed at one location these changes are reflected back on another 
location. Such synchronization is commonly known as "Mirroring". 
Mirroring is mostly used in cases when one needs to keep backup of their
 files on some remote server, so that if their local machine crashes or 
looses their important work, they have got it backed-up on the server.
</p><p>2. In the second type, two locations are sync'ed two-way, so that
 both of them are exactly identical if you open them any day. This means
 if some file is added, deleted or modified at one place, changes get 
reflected back on the other location and vice-versa. Such 
synchronizations are not commonly used for backup purposes because if 
somebody tampers with the files at your backing-up location, the files 
at the other locations end up getting tampered as well.
</p><p>There is also an addition to above techniques which may be 
required in some cases and not in other. If a file is deleted at one 
location, is it really required to delete it from the other location as 
well? Since deleting is an operation that is little more destructive, 
such a synchronization in which deletion of files is propagated to the 
other location as well might not be required all the time.
</p><p><b>File Synchronization Techniques:</b>:
</p><p>Although File synchronization may sound little too easy, it 
definitely has its own complexities and tricks in the bag. Following are
 some things which are generally taken care while talking about file 
synchronization as a whole:
</p><p>1. Delta Differencing: Delta differencing is a technique which 
actually makes file synchronization a whole lot more than doing FTP 
between two remote machines. It means that if there is a change in one 
file at one location, its just the change that travels down the network 
and other file is up-to-date'd based upon the changes alone. If we were 
to send whole file owing to changes of a degree of one or two 
characters, it might seize the network bandwidth big time.
</p><p>2. Security and encryption: Security is in itself one very 
important issue when it comes down to synchronizing files over two 
separately located machines connected through at least one router that 
links them to the Internet.
</p><p>3. Compression: If delta differencing is being performed by the 
underlying utility doing synchronization, it is already saving a lot of 
network bandwidth. But when it comes to adding big files and making 
bigger changes all the time, compressing the data before sending it 
across the network saves some bandwidth.
</p><p>4. Multiple locations syncing: There may be situations when one 
needs to replicate one location on more than one other locations. One 
way to achieve this is to perform pair-wise synchronization between 
every combination of machines possible. But this may lead to 
inconsistencies among different pairs. Another way, which is adapted by 
tools like Unison is to follow a star schema. In such schema, there is 
one central machine with which every other machine synchronizes. This 
solves the inconsistency problem.
</p><p>Above are listed some of the critical things that may decide a 
lot about file synchronization technique. In addition to those, there 
are some points that are lesser critical but may be more of aesthetics 
for the synchronization tool. These things include the tool being able 
to show its progress, failures, successes, performance, bandwidth 
utilization, etc.
</p><p><b>Tools for File Synchronization:</b>:
There are some file synchronization tools which are available, some of them are:
</p><p>1. Unison: Unison is open source (under GNU licence) and works 
over both windows and linux platforms. It allows synchronization from 
both directions, i.e., two-way synchronizations and key features like 
star schema for synchronizing multiple machines.
</p><p>2. RSync: RSync is more commonly used file synchronization tool 
which is also available with IBM AIX distribution. RSync was initially 
launched for Linux platform but now has been ported for Windows as well.
 It is a very flexibly configurable utility software with an array of 
options to configure it to work according to one's requirements. RSync 
has also got some tools which are built on top of it to provide GUI for 
the same. But most of them are not stable.
</p><p><b>The RSync Tool and Algorithm:</b>:
RSync is one of the most widely used tool for synchronizing files over 
various directories locally or remotely. For synchronization over 
network to remote sites, RSync can be configured with SSH public keys so
 that communication between the two nodes can be set up without 
authentication every time.
</p><p>RSync Algorithm: The RSync Algorithm was proposed by Andrew 
Tridgell and Paul Mackerras in June 1996. The problem that the algorithm
 tries to solve is that if there are two versions of a file X and Y on 
two different nodes A and B (respectively) that are connected over 
(slow) network, then what is the most optimized way of bringing the two 
versions of files X and Y to identical state ( let's say Y is to be 
updated to be equal to X ).
</p><p>Now, brute force technique would say just copy the file X over 
the network on B and replace Y. But the problem is if the network is 
slow enough and if it is choppy in nature, then copying whole file at 
once and with all its content to be copied may not be very efficient. 
Worst case being that the network link becomes unavailable after 99% of 
file getting copied. One solution is to chunk the file down into pieces.
 Then send only those chunk those are not yet copied. But still we are 
copying the whole file over.
The RSync algorithm given by Tridgell and Paul Mackerras is very 
efficient for network bandwidth since it transfers only those parts of 
files which have been updated and not the complete file. The major 
problem in such technique is that if we need to find difference between 
two files, they need to be physically present on the same machine. And 
if they are located on the same machine they do not need to be copied 
further, because the file has already been copied from remote server to 
make it available locally for finding the difference. Thus, the purpose 
is lost. For this problem, the RSync algorithm uses following technique:
</p><p><b>Setup:</b>:
</p><p>1. File X on node A has to be made consistent with file Y on node B
</p><p>2. Node A and B are connected over (slow) network.
</p><p><b>Algorithm:</b>:
</p><p>1. B splits the file Y into a series of non-overlapping fixed-sized chunks of size s. Last chunk need not be size s.
</p><p>2. B finds two checksums of each chunk, a weak checksum, i.e., rolling 32 bit checksum and a strong 128 bit MD5 checksum.
</p><p>3. B sends checksums to A.
</p><p>4. A finds checksums for every possible chunk if file X of size 
s. It compares weak checksum for every chunk with list of checksums sent
 over by B. Once a chunk (of X) is qualified for having same checksum 
with another chunk sent by B then it has to qualify for strong checksum 
with the same chunk. If both weak and strong checksum match, then the 
chunk is considered to be the same. Although, matching the checksums 
does not guarantee the blocks to be same, but there is negligible 
chances that two different chunks have same weak as well as strong 
checksums.
</p><p>5. Based upon above comparisons, A sends (to B) the offsets of 
chunks which matched and at what place those chunks are to be fit in Y. 
In addition to matched blocks, A also sends "literal" data, which is the
 data which did not match any block sent by B.
</p><p>6. B, upon receiving the chunks with their corresponding offsets (
 there where the chunk is to be inserted ) and the literal data with 
their corresponding offsets reconstructs the file Y, which is now same 
as X on A.
</p><p><b>Rolling Checksum And Its Properties:</b>
</p><p>Major time consuming step in above step is comparing the 
checksums sent over by B for every possible combination of chunks of 
size s on A. But, if the rolling checksum used in the algorithm has 
following property then this comparison step boils down to one parse of 
the file X:
</p><p>Calculating the checksum for a buffer X(2)...X(n+1) is a cheap operation given checksum for buffer X(1)...X(n), X(1) and X(n+1).
</p><p><b>Implementation:</b>
</p><p>For implementing file synchronization for EDX platform, we need 
to facilitate one admin who should be able to configure various 
directories that are to be synchronized and the admin should be able to 
monitor what are all the directories that are in progress of synching 
and which are pending to be synched, etc. For such functionalities, 
following method would be used:
</p><p>1. Admin is authenticated for username and password for logging 
into the system.This would be normal HTML page which will call a servlet
 running on the server to find out if the credentials are correct.
</p><p>2. Once the admin has logged in successfully, he should be able 
to see a list of servers that he is controlling for file 
synchronization. Here admin can select any server to work with. This is 
another HTML page.
</p><p>3. After selecting a server to monitor or make changes to, admin 
would see all the directories on the server which are being synchronized
 and what are their current status. This status would be updated every 5
 seconds. For this, the HTML page displaying all these status will fire 
Ajax queries to backend server and call one of its REST APIs to get 
status of all directories. For REST I will be using Spring REST APIs.
</p><p>4. Admin should be able to see progress of any running 
synchronization. This can again be accomplished through REST call to 
server.
</p><p><b>Progress:</b>
</p><p>Till now I have been able to make an HTML page which asks for 
authentication and a servlet which authenticates the admin. Once admin 
has been authenticated, he is sent to home page where he can supply the 
addresses of the directories which need to be synched. Once configured, 
admin can click a button to start synchronizing the configured 
directories. For this the HTML page calls a servlet which executes 
"rsync" command and starts synchronizing the directories.
</p><p><b>Phase 2:</b>
</p><p><b>Phase 1 review:</b>
</p><p>In phase 1 I had done the research over what is data 
synchronization, what are various algorithms available for 
synchronizing, etc. Brief points are as belows:
</p><p>1. Rsync is used widely for file synchronization.
</p><p>2. Rsync uses Rsync algorighm.
</p><p>3. Rsync comes as a command with Linux distributions.
</p><p>4. I will be developing a web application that will use above 
mentioned Rsync command to sync various servers distributed across 
country with others (edX servers particularly).
</p><p>5. This web application should give the flexibility for admins of
 colleges to define various "source-destination" pairs of various 
servers.
</p><p>6. Once admin sets up sources and destinations (i.e., server ips 
and directory paths which need to be synched), he should be able to 
schedule sync, view progress, etc.
</p><p><b>Questions that arose during phase 1 presentation</b>:
</p><p>Question 1. What about versioning?
</p><p>Answer: Versioning is particularly not required in such case 
because if there is a change in some file it is intended to be changed 
and professors will not be keeping 2 different versions of may be 
assignement file (questions) or videos or ppts that they share over 
time. Therefore complex softwares which provide versioning like SVN, 
Git, etc. are not solution.
</p><p>Question 2. What about parallelizing the task of synching?
</p><p>Answer: This can be thought of and we can try to figure out if 
there is a file that is present on more than one server then can we 
parallelize the process of synching third server with these two servers 
working parallel.
</p><p>But there are a couple of issues, like, if a file is present on 2
 servers then we need to make sure that this file is already in sync 
before using both these servers to sync with third server. Secondly, if 
we are synching one server with file that is kept on 2 different 
servers, then the server that is on the receiving end will become 
bottleneck if we try to parallelize the process of synching from 2 
different sources.
</p><p>Question 3. Can we provide Rsync facility over android devices?
</p><p>Answer: Yes we can, but the issue is that for Rsync command to 
work, one needs to boot the device which seizes the android device's 
warranty.
</p><p><b>Progress</b>
</p><p>1. User Management: <b>Done</b>
</p><p>For user management, I have kept different types of roles, ie., 
"admin" or "user". This will provide flexibility of which type of user 
is accessing the web application.
</p><p>2. Server Management: <b>Done</b>
</p><p>For Server management, I have prepared tables in MySql which can be used to add, remove or edit various servers.
</p><p>3. Directories Management: <b>Done</b>
</p><p>For Directories management, I have prepared tables in MySql which can be used to add, remove or edit various directories.
</p><p>4. RSync Command execution: <b>Done</b>
</p><p>For RSync command execution, I have called RSync command through a
 .sh file because calling the RSync command directly sometimes did not 
work. I'm still trying to figure out why did the RSync command not work 
if called directly from Java. If found I will call it directly, 
otherwise the workaround will do.
</p><p>5. Front end and Back end basics: <b>Done</b>
</p><p>Basic front end and back end, like, Spring framework for web 
application over Maven is done, which involves, making at least one 
Spring MVC Dispatcher servlet mapping for normal JSP page request, one 
for AJAX request ( returning JSON from POJO ) and front end side calling
 at least one .js, .css from back end Spring MVC.
</p><p>6. Scheduling RSync command: <b>In Progress</b>
</p><p>I'm currently working on making a backend service that will keep 
on checking the database for scheduled syncs that are pending and will 
execute them when time comes.
</p><p>7. Progress of sync: <b>Remaining</b>
</p><p>This will include parsing the output stream of RSync command and displaying the progress to the user accordingly.
</p><p>8. Extra facilities like map management etc: <b>Remaining</b>
</p><p>These things will be done at the end when basic web application 
is ready and time permits (most probably I will be able to accomplish 
these things as well).
</p><p><b>Progress Status 2:</b>
</p><p>1. Worked on maintaining Synchronization history in database. 
Needed because we need to store information about which directories have
 been called for synchronization and when did the synchronization start 
and when it ended, so that browser can retrieve these information 
through AJAX calls to server and display to admin status of various 
synchronizations going on or which have completed or failed.
</p><p>For this, created following table in database:
</p><p>synchistory(syncid, directoriesrelationid, syncstarttime, syncendtime)
</p><p>where, directoriesrelaionid is a foreign key to a table where 
relation between various directories is stored in a format that which 
directories are paired and which is source and which is destination.
</p><p>Currently, I have successfully handled inserting into this table values when a new sync process starts.
</p><p>2. Module that spawns a new process for synchronizing two 
directories has been implemented for basic synchronization. Java creates
 a new process using Runtime.getRuntime().exec() command. Java method 
that calls this method takes two araguments, i.e., source directory path
 and destination directory path. Upon receiving these two parameters, it
 spawns a new process that calls a batch file which in turn takes two 
arguments which is same as above directory paths. This batch file then 
calls "rsync" command on these two directories to start the sync 
process.
</p><p>Once the process has started, Java module takes input stream of 
the batch file's process as one of the variables in itself. This is done
 through Process.getInputStream() method so that input stream of the 
process gets attached to one of the InputStream variable in Java. Once 
we attach InputStream variable with Process's input stream, whatever 
output of process is generated gets streamed into the java InputStream 
variable. Next we use BufferedReader to collect output of the process to
 collect stream's data into one line of string. Advantage of using 
BufferedReader is that we can perform operations on each line of 
process's output instead of each character and also the output of 
process does not need to be read in real time thus buffering and reading
 will not hamper performance or functionality by any means.
</p><p>Additionally, I have created a new thread for every request that 
comes for synchronizing a directory. Purpose of such approach is that if
 there is a big directory for which we start synchronization process, it
 will take a lot of time to complete. If such synchronization process 
was started through AJAX request from browser, then this request will 
take a lot of time to complete. Hence, if we do not spawn a new thread, 
request will keep on waiting for the synchronization to complete. Such a
 request that takes lot of time to complete are not good practice and 
also there are request time outs that may occur if synchronization takes
 very long to complete. This affects user experience.
</p><p>Therefore, main controller servlet takes the request and spawns a
 new thread that takes care of spawning a new process of synchronization
 and also takes care of logging, etc. The main servlet, after spawning 
the thread returns back the response to the user which is id of 
"synchistory" table's new entry.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 3:</b>
</p><p><b>SSH Checker:</b>
</p><p>Written a module in spring controller which is basically a 
RESTful service and serves the purpose of telling the client whether a 
server (ip-address) is 'ssh-reachable' or not.
</p><p><b>SSH-Reachable:</b>
</p><p>Calling a server 'ssh-reachable' if current server can talk to remote server through ssh. This includes 3 parameters:
</p><p>1. Current server should have ssh enabled.
</p><p>2. Remote server should have ssh enabled.
</p><p>3. Remote server's public ssh key should be included in the "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" file in current server.
</p><p>ssh is required because "rsync" works over ssh to communicate 
between master and slave servers. Point 3 is essential because if remote
 server's public ssh key is not included in above mentioned file, then, 
slave will not be able to login through ssh without master's password, 
and if the key is authorized then slave can login into master through 
ssh without entering passowrd. Therefore, in order for "rsync" to 
communicate over ssh, remote server's public key must be included in the
 list of authorized_keys of current server. Multiple keys can be entered
 in "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" file, where each key is entered in new 
line.
</p><p>Hence the job of "ssh-checker" is to get the ip-address of a 
server (or hostname), try to connect to that server through ssh and 
return 0 or 1 based upon whether it was able to connect to server or 
not. But this involves some complexities. First of all, there is some 
latency involved in trying to connect to the server through ssh. So, we 
cannot be sure if the server is unreachable therefore no output is 
coming from "ssh" command or if it is because of the latency. For 
solving this, following strategy is used:
</p><p>1. When a request for "ssh-checker" comes, "ssh-checker" spawns a new thread "SshChecker".
</p><p>2. "SshChecker" thread launches a new process (through 
Runtime.getRuntime()) and establishes IPC to this process through 
InputStream and OutputStream.
</p><p>3. After spawning new thread, main thread of "ssh-checker" calls 
join(int millis) method on this newly created thread. join() method 
makes the main thread to wait for child thread to finish its job. But if
 we specify "millis" argument in join() method, then main thread will 
wait for only that many milliseconds. So, by default main thread is 
waiting for 10 seconds (this can be configured) for child thread to 
finish.
</p><p>4. Child thread reads InputStream of spawned process which in 
turn calls "ssh" on specified server. "ssh" command does following:
</p><p>i. If public ssh key of local server is included in authorized 
keys of remote server, then it gives some output on it's output stream 
(which is generally displayed on terminal when it                is 
called from terminal.
</p><p>ii. Java thread that spawned this process waits for at least 2 
lines to appear in Process's input stream. If lines appear, it can 
return that ssh connection is possible to remote server.
</p><p>iii. But if ssh key of local server is not included in the 
authorized keys of remote server, then ssh waits of user to enter 
password of remote server. And in such case, there is no output on the 
output stream of the process. Thus the child thread keeps waiting for 
input to come on process's input stream.
</p><p>iv. Main thread after spawning the child thread waits for 10 
seconds (configurable) to return. But if ssh is not able to connect, 
child thread cannot return and after 10 seconds main thread calls 
interrupt() method on child thread and returns 0, which means remote 
server cannot be reached through ssh.
</p><p>5. Based upon the result of "ssh-checker" service call (0/1), web
 UI renders server as green (successful in connecting through ssh) or 
red (unsuccessful in connecting through ssh).
</p><p><b>Progress Status 4:</b>
</p><p>Completed "ssh-checker" functionality. Now working on "Schedule-handler" module. This module's responsibility is as follows:
</p><p>1. It scans all the directory pairs which need to be synched. 
After getting the ids of all relations, it looks for latest entry of 
each id in "synchistory" table.
</p><p>2. For each entry in "synchistory", it checks if end time of the 
sync is NULL or not. If it is NULL, that means sync is still in 
progress.
</p><p>3. If the end time value is not NULL, then it retrieves the end 
time value from "synchistory" and matches it with the "syncinterval" of 
current pair and finds out if current time has surpassed the interval at
 which it needed to sync current pair of directories. If yes, it 
launches a new thread which starts synching two directories, if not, it 
simply discards current pair and continues the same for other pairs of 
directories.
</p><p>4. It performs these steps at an interval of 1 minute. This is 
accomplished by using Thread.sleep(60000) method on the 
"ScheduleHandler" thread.
</p><p><br>
<b>Progress Status 5: </b>
</p><p>1. Completed SSHChecer and scheduling components. "Sync Now" 
facility first checks if SSH connection to remote server is possible or 
not. If the connection is not possible, it does not try to sync two 
directories. On the other hand if SSH connection to remote server is 
possible then it starts the sync process as normal.
</p><p>2. Added a button on the UI which says "Check SSH" and upon 
clicking the button an AJAX call is made to spring restful service which
 tries to make SSH connection to remote server and returns whether it 
was able to make SSH connection properly or not. Accordingly, UI 
displays green arrow or red cross against the server.
</p><p>3. Started working on "View History" component, wherein if admin 
selects two directories and clicks "View History" button, he should be 
able to see at what times these directories were synched and what were 
their corresponding logs.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 6:</b>
</p><p>1. Completed "View History" module.
</p><p><b>Reverse Ssh Checker Module:</b>
</p><p>This module checks if reverse ssh works for remote server to 
local server or not. For this, I have created a restful server 
"reverseSshChecker" which accepts an ipaddress and a port. For this 
ipAddress and port, this service uses Apache HttpClient library to fire 
call on the "Synchronization" application running on the remote server 
for "sshChecker". So, "reverseSshChecker" in turn calls "sshChecker" of 
remote server and forwards the results as it is to the browser. However,
 "sshChecker" itself needs the ipAddress of the server with which ssh 
connection needs to be checked. For this ipAddress, "reverseSshChecker" 
takes local ip and sends it to "sshChecker" of remote server. This 
ipAddress can be taken via NetworkInterfaces.getNetworkInterfaces() 
method and then applying isSiteLocal() method on returned interfaces.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 7:</b>
</p><p>Changed the implementation of "reverseSshChecker" module such 
that it now passes local machine's hostname instead of ip-address. Still
 trying to figure out pros and cons of using ip-address vs hostname. The
 hostname is achieved by creating a new process through 
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("hostname"). This will call "hostname" command
 which returns hostname of the local system. The returned hostname is 
received using newly created process's inputStream. This hostname is 
then passed as argument to remote server's "sshChecker" service which 
returns whether it was able to make proper connection to the passed 
server's hostname.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 8:</b>
</p><p>"Check Availability" module completed.
</p><p><b>"Check Availability" Module:</b>
</p><p>This module checks availability of local and/or remote 
directories. Admin has rights to create directory pairs which need to be
 synched and which may be present locally or remotely. Once a directory 
pair is created there are two possibilities:
</p><p>1. Selected directory is present locally: In such cases, while 
sending the list of directories which are present locally it checks if 
the directory exists or not and if it is a directory and not a file.
</p><p>2. Selected directory is present remotely: In such cases, there's
 a button "Check Availability" on UI which when clicked calls a service 
"/isRemoteDirectoryExist" for every such directory and pass their 
corresponding directory path. This service then takes the directory path
 and composes a new HttpClient request with the directory path and calls
 "/isLocalDirectoryExist" service on remote server. This service checks 
if given directory path exists and is directory and returns the results.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 9:</b>
</p><p>Rsync command status Module completed.
</p><p><b>Rsync command status Module:</b>
</p><p>This module is responsible for checking if a rsync process was 
stated by the application then is it still running or something went 
wrong with it. For this following strategy is applied:
</p><p>1. Whenever a new process is initiated (for rsync), a new entry 
is added in the "synchistory" table with a new id and "syncstarttime" as
 current time and other entries null.
</p><p>2. For every process that is initiated (for rsync), a new thread (PrcossStatusChecker Thread) is launched.
</p><p>3. "ProcessStatusChecker" Thread loops through and for every 
iteration (with a time delay of 10 seconds) it checks if the process's 
"syncendtime" entry exists in the "synchistory" table or not. If it does
 that means the process has completed and it simply kills itself.
</p><p>4. IF "syncendtime" entry does not exist that means the process is still running.
</p><p>5. Rsync process launcher module keeps reading the outputs 
generated from the process and keeps updating the new line in "synclog" 
column of "synchistory" table for that process's row. Along with the 
"synclog", it also updates "lastupdated" column to current timestamp so 
that we keep track of when was last input available from corresonding 
process. Rsync command's property is that it keeps writing to standard 
output every second and updates what is the file being transferred and 
how much of it has been transferred in percentage. So, if a process is 
running successfully then "lastupdated" column for that process will 
never cross 1 second or so from current time.
</p><p>6. If "ProcessStatusChecker" thread finds "syncendtime" column 
null then it looks for "lastupdated" column. If "lastupdated" column is 
null that means no output has been given by the process yet. In such 
case it calculates the difference between current time and 
"syncstarttime" and if it exceeds 120 seconds, it kills the process and 
itself along with making the entry for "iskilled" column as "true" in 
"synchistory" table's row for that process.
</p><p>7. Similarly, if "ProcessStatusChecker" thread finds 
"syncendtime" column null and "lastupdated" column is not null then it 
finds difference between current time and "lastupdated" time and 
proceeds as defined in step 6.
</p><p>8. At the end of process, p.exitValue() is checked which is 0 if 
the process is successful and non-zero if there was some error. "Process
 Launcher" module checks exitValue() and if it is 0 then it sets 
"processstatus" column's value as "Successful" in the "synchistory" 
table's corresponding row and sets the value to "Failed: 
&lt;exitValue&gt;" if exitValue() is not 0.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 10:</b>
</p><p>Completed Notifications Module
</p><p><b>Notifications Module:</b>
</p><p>Whenever a process fails (rsync command fails and returns a 
non-zero exitValue()), an entry is made into the "notificationinfo" 
table in the database. Schema of "notificationinfo" table is as follows:
</p><p>notificationinfo(notificationid int primary key autogenerated, 
synchistoryid int, notificationtext varchar(100), notificationcreated 
datetime, isread boolean, notificationcode int);
</p><p>"notificationid" is auto-generated primary key. "synchistoryid" 
is foreign key to "synchistory" table's primary key. This column will 
link each notification to the process which it corresponds to. 
"notificationtext" is the text that is to be displayed in "Notifications
 Box" on UI. This contains the source and destination directory paths 
along with the remote server's name and date at which this notification 
was created.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 11:</b>
</p><p>Working on couple of additional things. Will update Wiki as soon as it is complete.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 12</b>
</p><p>Android Application has been developed which does the following:
</p><p>1. User inputs login id and password which gets verified from the server.
</p><p>2. In next activity user can select the college and the server which he/she wishes to monitor.
</p><p>3. In next activity user can select the local directory (source 
or destination) and the remote directory which he wishes to monitor.
</p><p>4. History of the directory pair selected is shown in the next 
screen. This shows various "start-times" of sync processes that happened
 for selected directory pair. User can select any one from the list and 
logs for that particular instance of sync process are displayed below 
the list.
</p><p>5. User can also select "Sync Now" option in order to start sync process instantly.
</p><p><b>Remaining:</b>
</p><p>1. Configurable server domain name or ip-address: This requires 
adding the server name to database and allowing user to change this over
 time (if required).
</p><p>2. Notification Manager Module: This module will have a service 
running in the background which keeps polling server for any unread 
notifications and will generate one notification for all the unread 
logs.
</p><p><b>Progress Status 13:</b>
</p><p>1. Notifications Module to check for notifications completed.
</p><p>This module contains a service that runs in the background and 
every 20 seconds it connects to the server and finds out what are the 
notifications and creates notifications for every notification sent over
 by server if it is not read yet. Notification created contains all the 
data that needs to be displayed along with other information. When user 
clicks on the notification, the notification clears off and opens up the
 "ManageServer" activity along with the server on which that particular 
sync activity failed. User can then select the directories and view logs
 to know what went wrong.
</p><p>This module also makes sure that a notification that is already 
shown to user does not get repeated. For this, an 
ArrayList&lt;NotificationInfo&gt; notificationsShown is maintained which
 keeps on adding those notifications that have been already notified to 
the user. Upon receiving notifications from the server, module scans 
over all the notifications and first checks if "isRead" property of 
current notification is set to true or false. If it is true, then it 
discards that notification and if it is false it continues further. If 
"isRead" property is false, module then checks if the "notificationId" 
property of current notification is already present in 
"notificationsShown" variable or not. If it is already present then 
module discards that notification and if it is not present then a 
notification is generated for the notification.
