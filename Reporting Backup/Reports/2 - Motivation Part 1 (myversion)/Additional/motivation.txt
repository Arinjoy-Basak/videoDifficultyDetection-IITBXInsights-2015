
ANALYTICS OF THE INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS IN A PARTICULAR COURSE

1) How much time students spent in viewing the videos ?
2) How much time student spent thinking on a particular 
   question ? 
3) How many did he try to attempt a diificult question before
   giving up ?
4) How active is a student on discussion boards ?
5) Are the answers and questions of the students being applauded
   in the discussion board ?
6) Is the student also spending equal amount of time with
   ungraded quizzes, and extra problems that are given to those
   who want to go a little bit further ?

The analytics for these questions will help figure out the interest shown by the students for a particular course.

And when provided with incentives to be awarded to show the interests, more students will show interest, and increased interest will lead to increased learning.




ANALYTICS TO HELP THE INTROVERTS.

1) Many students hesitate in asking questions or discussing their
   doubts.
2) In a classroom scenario, this will help the teachers see these
   visual analytics, and help such studetns.
3) Ultimately, this will make sure that no one is left behind in
   a classroom that has students with different abilities.
