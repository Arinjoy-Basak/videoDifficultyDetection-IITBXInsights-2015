SUCCESS!!!!

pip installed and updated via  "sudo pip install --upgrade pip" !! Weed for everybody!!!

So steps:
i) 	Install pip through "sudo apt-get install python-pip" ---but that's not all!! It's version 1.0 (damn old shit...).
ii)	Then, upgrade the thing: sudo pip install --upgrade pip
iii) Then, proceed.

unable to update npm for installation.

So, downloaded the 0.12.4 package of node, ran:
cp to local
./configure
make
make install
which node
and then make develop in dashboard.

Problem: unable to launch data api from dashboard.

Error: running ./manage.py runserver --settings=analyticsdataserver.settings.local_mysql gives a server error. on terminal, it shows as: ImproperlyConfigured: Error loading MySQLdb module

Solution: install pip install mysql-python

But this creates a problem. So bypassed proxy with mobile internet, and got EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found

Solution: install libmysqlclient-dev

sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

Once that's done, run "./manage.py ...etc." again, and go to 127.0.0.1:8000.

It should show the edx data analytics page for documentation.
